We can do this with the `index` which is an attribute of the pandas Series object. Specifically, every Series (and DataFrame) in pandas has an index attribute that gives access to the index labels of the Series.\n","\n","5) Finally, we will convert what we have to a python list, and you have learned how to do this in the lecture slides (now on Canvas).\n","\n","You can do it!
