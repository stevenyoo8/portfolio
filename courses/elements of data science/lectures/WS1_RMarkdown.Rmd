## R Markdown

Much of the work in this class will be done via **R Markdown documents.** R Markdown documents combine text (with some formatting options), R code, and R outputs including figures. They are a great way to produce self-contained, reproducible, well-documented data analyses.

In this first *.Rmd* worksheet, you will learn how to do some basic markdown editing, continue to explore **base R**, include some **R packages**, and how to import **datasets**. After you have made changes to the document, press "Knit" on the top of this pane and see what you get: hopefully an *html* file! It will complain in the console if some part of the code is not working; troubleshooting is part of programming life!

Edit below this line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Basic Markdown editing

Let's try out basic R Markdown features, as described [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html): try different headers, make a numbered list and a bulleted list, write some text that is bold and some that is in italics, try the block-quote feature.

# For

## Example

### These

#### Are

##### Different

###### Headers

1.  Here
2.  Are
3.  Four
4.  Things

-   bullet 1

    -   sub-bullet 1

-   bullet 2

    -   sub-bullet 2

-   bullet 3

    -   sub-bullet 3

You can use some basic formatting:

Modify font:\
**bold** or **bold**\
*italic* or *italic*\
***bold and italic***, also ***bold and italic***\
~~strikethrough~~

> Create a blockquote

## 2. Embedded R code

R code embedded in chunks will be executed and the output will be shown in the *html* file (unless specified otherwise with `echo=FALSE`).

R comes with several built-in datasets, which are generally used as demo data for playing with R functions. The dataset used in the following code chunk is `cars`, which lists speed (mph) and stopping distance (ft) for cars from the 1920s. You can run all the code in a chunk at once by using the play button on the top right of the chunk or you can submit code line by line like we did in a regular R script.

```{r}
# Display the first 6 rows of the dataset
head(cars)

# Grab just the third row
cars[3,]

# Grab just the second column...
cars[,2]

# ... which is the same as grabbing the column by name
cars$dist
```

Let's describe our variables:

```{r}
# Calculate the mean of each variable
mean(cars$speed)
mean(cars$dist)

# Another important statistic: standard deviation
sd(cars$speed)
sd(cars$dist)

# Or find descriptive statistics for all variables in the dataset with summary()
summary(cars)
```

#### **Try it! Recall logical indexing using `[ , ]`. Only display the cars that have a stopping distance greater than the mean.**

```{r}
# Write code here
cars[cars$dist > mean(cars$dist), ]
```

## 3. Plots and other outputs

You can easily embed plots too! You can hide the code with the option `echo=FALSE` in the code chunk settings to only display the plot. For example, you see these different plots in the *html* file with no code:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a basic histogram
hist(cars$speed,
     # Label the axis of your graph
     xlab = "Speed (mph)")

# Create a basic boxplot
boxplot(cars$dist, 
     # Label the axis of your graph
     ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)")

# Create a basic scatterplot (variable on x-axis first, then variable on y-axis)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist,
     # Give a title to your graph
     main = "Relationship between Speed and Stopping distance",
     # Label axes
     xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)")
```

We will learn fancy visualizations in the next part of this unit but basic plots are useful for simple and quick visualizations.

You can create some basic table to summarize each of the variables using the means calculated in a previous code chunk:

|      | speed    | distance |
|------|----------|----------|
| mean | 15.4 mph | 42.98 ft |
| sd   | 5.3 mph  | 25.8 ft  |

## 4. Typesetting equations and functions

You can include `LaTeX` code both inline (between single dollar-signs) and in blocks (between double dollar-signs). For example, below is a formula for calculating the z-score (the relative position of an observation compared to the mean):

$$
z = \frac{X_i - mean(X)}{sd(X)}
$$

#### **Try it! What is the z-score for a car with a stopping distance of 120 feet?**

```{r}
# Write code here
(120 - mean(cars$dist))/sd(cars$dist)


```

## 5. HTML hyperlinks, images etc.

[Here is a hyperlink to Canvas](https://canvas.utexas.edu)

Here is an image from a URL (for local images, just specify the file path in place of the URL) \# use "[]" before link in parenthesis ![](https://news.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bevo-9841-2100x1398-e2000d2b-a7a1-448c-83d5-281310430e66-1024x682.jpg)

## 6. Packages

R packages are collections of functions and datasets developed by the R community. You can install a package by typing the function `install.packages(“package_name”)` **in the console** panel. *Note: using `install.packages()` in your Markdown document will prevent you from knitting.*

Once installed, you need to load packages using `library(package_name)`.

For example, let's install and load the package `MASS`:

```{r}
# Copy/paste the following in your console to install the package (without #)
# install.packages("MASS")

# Load the package within the Markdown file
library(MASS)
```

`MASS` contains more built-in datasets. Take a look by running `data()` **in the console**. Let's save the first one into our environment:

```{r}
# Save the data into your environment
mydata <- Animals
```

It is always a good idea to give a different name to the dataset that are saved into your environment... Because what if you make some unfortunate changes to the original dataset?? See this post for a solution: <https://community.rstudio.com/t/need-help-resetting-r-dataset-to-its-original-form/81416>

## 7. Importing datasets

While we will use a lot of built-in datasets, we should also be able to import other datasets of interest into RStudio. Let's import a *.csv* file for practice. We will import the `pokemon` dataset (download it from Canvas and save it in your working directory, i.e. where all your R files live, using Upload). In your working directory, click on the dataset name and select *Import dataset*. Make sure the *First Rows as Names* option is checked and uncheck the *Open Data Viewer*. Notice that there is some R code created on the bottom right of this window? That's the code you will need to import data in your RMarkdown. It should look like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
pokemon <- read_csv("/Users/stevenyoo/Desktop/SDS322E/pokemon.csv")
```

There are other ways to import a dataset but that's the most convenient since it also provides the code to create the object of the dataset in the environment. **Important**: your RMarkdown file is independent from the environment you see on the right, meaning that all objects used in your document must be created or uploaded *within* the document.

As the semester goes on, we will learn more ways to import data (from GitHub, for example). But it is always important to take a quick look at the data:

```{r}
# All these functions give different types of information about the data
str(pokemon)
head(pokemon)
dim(pokemon)
nrow(pokemon)
ncol(pokemon)
```

You can view the entire dataset by clicking on the `pokemon` object in the environment or by running `View(pokemon)` **in the console**. *Note: using `View()` in your Markdown document will prevent you from knitting.*

## 8. Source or Visual view

Some Markdown features are easier to manipulate in the Visual editor. You can switch between the two views by clicking on your preferred option above (top left of this pane).

## Your turn!

Let's explore the `pokemon` dataset.

1.  Pick one of the numeric variables and create an appropriate plot to represent the distribution. Calculate summary statistics.

```{r}
# Write code here
plot(pokemon$HP, pokemon$Attack,
     main = "Pokemon HP vs. Attack", 
     xlab = "HP", 
     ylab = "Attack")

```

2.  Investigate the relationship between two numeric variables with a graph. Do you notice any trend?

```{r}
# Write code here

```

3.  Post your plot on the following slideshow with your code in the speakers note on bottom: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FC5Xuala2Zw1pON3owpFA2LTh3oEixJXM_u5PVJKYVU/edit?usp=sharing>
