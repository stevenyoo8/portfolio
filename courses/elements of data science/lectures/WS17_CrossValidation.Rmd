```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
# The following code is a basic setup of options for your document
# You won't have to edit it (unless you want to!)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE,  
                      warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,

```

## 1. Set up

We will use many packages again today! `tidyverse`, `plotROC`, `caret`, `rpart`, `rpart.plot` and `randomForest`:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(plotROC)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
```

Recall the `biopsy` dataset that contains information about tumor biopsy results. Nine features of the tumor were measured (on a 1-10 scale) as well as the `outcome` variable (malignant vs. benign). Let's recode the `outcome` variable as 0 (benign) and 1 (malignant):

```{r}
# Upload the data from GitHub
biopsy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laylaguyot/datasets/main//Biopsy.csv")

# Take a quick look
sample_n(size = 5, biopsy)
```

Our goal is to validate the different classifiers we have explore to predict malignancy: logistic regression, kNN, and decision tree.

In the last worksheet, we compared the three classifiers (logistic regression, kNN, decision tree) considering all potential predictors in `biopsy`. Let's visualize the ROC curve of each classifier on the same plot. Note: the predict() function has a different syntax depending on which model we use. It might be a good idea to add some color to differentiate the models. Which classifier seem to perform better? worse? 

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model
biopsy_log <- glm(outcome ~ ., data = biopsy %>%
                    mutate(outcome = ifelse(outcome == "benign", 0, 1)), # needs a binary outcome 0 or 1
                  family = "binomial")

# Fit the kNN model
biopsy_kNN <- knn3(outcome ~ ., data = biopsy, k = 5)

# Fit the decision tree model
biopsy_tree <- rpart(outcome ~ ., data = biopsy, method = "class") 

# ROC curves: Note the different syntax for predict() depending on the model
ggplot(biopsy) + 
  geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predict(biopsy_log, type = "response")), n.cuts = 0, color = "blue") +
  geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predict(biopsy_kNN, biopsy)[,2]), n.cuts = 0, color = "orange") +
  geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predict(biopsy_tree, biopsy)[,2]), n.cuts = 0) +
  labs(caption = "Blue = Logistic Regression, 
                  Orange = kNN, 
                  Black = Decistion tree") +
  xlim(0,0.25) # "zoom" on the top left corner
```

But how would each of these models be helpful to predict the malignancy `outcome` based on new data?

## 2. Train and Test sets

We will separate our entire dataset into a `train` set to train our model and a `test` set to test our model:

```{r}
# Define a sampling process
sample_process <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), # take value TRUE or FALSE
                 nrow(biopsy), # for each row in biopsy
                 replace = TRUE, # TRUE or FALSE can repeat
                 prob = c(0.7, 0.3)) # 70% TRUE, 30% FALSE

# Select values for the train set (corresponding to TRUEs in sample_process)
train_biopsy <- biopsy[sample_process, ]

# Select values for the test set (corresponding to FALSEs in sample_process)
test_biopsy <- biopsy[!sample_process, ]

nrow(biopsy)
nrow(train_biopsy) + nrow(test_biopsy)
```

### a. Logistic regression

First, we fit the logistic regression model on the `train` set only:

```{r}
# Fit a logistic regression model with all predictors
biopsy_log <- glm(outcome ~ ., data = train_biopsy %>% # focus on train set
                    mutate(outcome = ifelse(outcome == "benign", 0, 1)),
                  family = "binomial")
```

Let's compare the predictions on the `train` set and on the `test` set:

```{r}
# Results in a data frame for train data
predict_train <- data.frame(
  predictions = predict(biopsy_log, newdata = train_biopsy, type = "response"),
  outcome = train_biopsy$outcome,
  name = "train")

# Results in a data frame for test data
predict_test <- data.frame(
  predictions = predict(biopsy_log, newdata = test_biopsy, type = "response"),
  outcome = test_biopsy$outcome,
  name = "test")

# Combined results
predict_combined <- rbind(predict_train, predict_test)
```

Let's evaluate the performance of our classifier on the `train` and `test` sets:

```{r}
ggplot(predict_combined) + 
  geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predictions, color = name), n.cuts = 0) +
  labs(title = "ROC curve for logistic regression")
```

How does the performance on the `train` set compares to the `test` set?

Did we all get the same ROC curves? Why/Why not?
no, random sampling for train

### b. Other classifiers

We can also train and test other classifiers.

#### **Try it! In a team of 2, each student picks a classifier (kNN or decision tree) to train and test the model on some part of the data. Train your classifier on the `train` set and compare the performance for predicting malignancy with all predictors on the `train` set vs on the `test` set. Is there any sign of overfitting?**

```{r}
# kNN model
biopsy_kNN <- knn3(outcome ~ ., data = train_biopsy, k = 5)

# make prediction
predict_train <- data.frame(
  predictions = predict(biopsy_kNN, newdata = train_biopsy)[,2],
  outcome = train_biopsy$outcome,
  name = "train")

# Results in a data frame for test data
predict_test <- data.frame(
  predictions = predict(biopsy_log, newdata = test_biopsy, type = "response"),
  outcome = test_biopsy$outcome,
  name = "test")

# Combined results
predict_combined <- rbind(predict_train, predict_test)

# ROC
ggplot(predict_combined) + 
  geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predictions, color = name), n.cuts = 0) +
  labs(title = "ROC curve for kNN")

-----------------------------------------------------------------

# decision tree model
biopsy_tree <- rpart(outcome ~ ., data = train_biopsy, method = "class") 

# make prediction
predict_train <- data.frame(
  predictions = predict(biopsy_tree, newdata = train_biopsy)[,2],
  outcome = train_biopsy$outcome,
  name = "train")

# Results in a data frame for test data
predict_test <- data.frame(
  predictions = predict(biopsy_tree, newdata = test_biopsy, type = "response"),
  outcome = test_biopsy$outcome,
  name = "test")

# Combined results
predict_combined <- rbind(predict_train, predict_test)

# ROC
ggplot(predict_combined) + 
  geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predictions, color = name), n.cuts = 0) +
  labs(title = "ROC curve for kNN")
```

## 3. Cross-validation

Our results might differ depending on which `train` set and `test` set we considered. Let's try two methods to compare performance over multiple test sets: k-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation.

### a. k-fold cross-validation

The principle for 𝑘-fold cross-validation is to:

-   Divide datasets into 𝑘 equal parts (usually 5 or 10)

-   Use 𝑘−1 parts as the train set, and the remaining part as the test set

-   Repeat 𝑘 times, so each part has been used once as a test set

-   Average performance over 𝑘 tests

First, we will create the different folds:

```{r}
# Choose number of folds (split data into 10 parts)
k = 10 

# Randomly order rows in the dataset
data <- biopsy[sample(nrow(biopsy)), ] 

# Create k folds from the dataset (break rows into k parts)
folds <- cut(seq(1:nrow(data)), breaks = k, labels = FALSE)
```

Then we fit a logistic regression model and repeat the process for each 𝑘-fold (using a for-loop):

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# Initialize a vector to keep track of the performance
perf_k <- NULL

# Use a for loop to get diagnostics for each test set
for(i in 1:k){
  # Create train and test sets
  train_not_i <- data[folds != i, ] # all observations except in fold i
  test_i <- data[folds == i, ]  # observations in fold i
  
  # Train model on train set (all but fold i)
  biopsy_log <- glm(outcome ~ ., data = train_not_i %>%
                    mutate(outcome = ifelse(outcome == "benign", 0, 1)),
                  family = "binomial")
  
  # Test model on test set (fold i)
  predict_i <- data.frame(
    predictions = predict(biopsy_log, newdata = test_i, type = "response"),
    outcome = test_i$outcome)
  
  # Consider the ROC curve for the test dataset
  ROC <- ggplot(predict_i) + 
    geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predictions))

  # Get diagnostics for fold i (AUC)
  perf_k[i] <- calc_auc(ROC)$AUC
}
```

Finally, find the average performance on new data:

```{r}
# Average performance 
mean(perf_k)
```

What does it tell us?

#### **Try it! In the same team of 2, each student picks a different classifier (kNN or decision tree) to validate the model. Apply the k-fold cross-validation with the classifier of your choice to predict malignancy with all predictors. How well did your classifier perform on average?**

```{r}
# Write code here
# Initialize a vector to keep track of the performance
perf_k <- NULL

# Use a for loop to get diagnostics for each test set
for(i in 1:k){
  # Create train and test sets
  train_not_i <- data[folds != i, ] # all observations except in fold i
  test_i <- data[folds == i, ]  # observations in fold i
  
  # Train model on train set (all but fold i)
  biopsy_kNN <- knn3(outcome ~ ., data = train_not_i, k = 5) 
  
  # Test model on test set (fold i)
  predict_i <- data.frame(
    predictions = predict(biopsy_kNN, newdata = test_i)[,2],
    outcome = test_i$outcome)
  
  # Consider the ROC curve for the test dataset
  ROC <- ggplot(predict_i) + 
    geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = predictions))

  # Get diagnostics for fold i (AUC)
  perf_k[i] <- calc_auc(ROC)$AUC
}
```

### b. Leave-One-Out cross-validation

The principle for Leave-One-Out cross-validation (LOOCV) is to:

-   Use 𝑛−1 observations / rows as train set

-   Test model on remaining observation

-   Repeat 𝑛 times, so each observation has been left out once

-   Average performance over 𝑛 tests

We leave out one observation at a time:

```{r}
# Initialize a data frame to test
tests <- data.frame()

# Use a for loop to leave out one observation at a time
for(i in 1:nrow(biopsy)){
  # Create train and test sets
  train_not_i <- biopsy[-i, ] # all observations but i
  test_i <- biopsy[i, ]   # observation i
  
  # Train model on train set (all but observation i)
  biopsy_log <- glm(outcome ~ ., data = train_not_i %>%
                    mutate(outcome = ifelse(outcome == "benign", 0, 1)),
                    family = "binomial")
  
  # Compare predicted probability to the truth
  tests <- rbind(tests, c(
    predict(biopsy_log, newdata = test_i, type = "response"), 
    outcome = test_i$outcome))
  names(tests) <- c("predictions","outcome")
}
```

Let's evaluate performance with average AUC:

```{r}
# Consider the ROC curve for the results on tests
ROC <- ggplot(tests) + geom_roc(aes(d = outcome, m = as.numeric(predictions)), n.cuts = 10)
ROC

# Get overall performance (AUC)
calc_auc(ROC)
```

### c. A function for cross-validation

There is a function `train()` in the `caret` package that trains the model and conducts cross-validation with `trainControl()`.

```{r}
# Cross validation for the logistic regression model
logistic_cv <- train(outcome ~ .,
      data = biopsy ,
      # Type of model
      method = "glm",
      # Cross validation: 10 folds
      trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10),
      family = "binomial")

# Let's take a look at the output
logistic_cv
# k is the number of neighbors
```

```{r}
# Cross validation for the kNN model
kNN_cv <- train(outcome ~ .,
      data = biopsy,
      method = "knn",
      trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)) # 10-fold cv

# Let's take a look at the output
kNN_cv
# k is the number of neighbors
```

```{r}
# Cross validation for the decision tree model
tree_cv <- train(outcome ~ .,
      data = biopsy,
      method = "rpart",
      trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))

# Let's take a look at the output
tree_cv
# cp stands for Complexity Parameter of the tree
```

We could also try the cross-validation with `LOOCV` in the `train()` function.

## Your turn!

Issues of overfitting are more pronounced using a smaller dataset. Consider the built-in dataset called `mtcars` that has 32 observations to predict transmission (`am` = 0 if automatic, 1 if manual) based on `weight` and `cylinders`.

```{r}
# Take a quick look at the data
head(mtcars)
```

1.  Pick one classifier (logistic regression, kNN, or decision tree). Fit the model on the entire dataset to predict transmission based on `wt` and `cyl`. How well does your classifier perform?

```{r}
# Try it!

```

2.  Split 80% of `mtcars` into a train set and the remaining 20% as a test set. Is there any sign of overfitting? Report the overall and average performance of your classifier in this spreadsheet: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14frvuvkCrDpXramI2q9ondOe6PIPo5X31K32oZe8E74/edit?usp=sharing>

```{r}
# Try it!

```

3.  Using the grid below, represent the decision boundary of your model within two graphs: one representing the data in your train dataset, one representing the data in your test set. Is there any visual sign of overfitting? Report your plots and the average performance of your classifier in this slideshow: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qF_-XGkL_veQcBI-AkEgR7feRRzZmkZhRe26afow3P0/edit?usp=sharing>

```{r}
# Make a grid (values for x and y) to layout the contour geom
grid <- data.frame(expand.grid(wt = seq(min(mtcars$wt),
                                            max(mtcars$wt),
                                            length.out = 100),
                               cyl = seq(min(mtcars$cyl),
                                      max(mtcars$cyl),
                                      length.out = 100)))

# Try it!

```
